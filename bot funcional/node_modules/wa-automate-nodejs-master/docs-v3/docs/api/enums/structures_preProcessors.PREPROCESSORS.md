[structures/preProcessors](/api/modules/structures_preProcessors.md).PREPROCESSORS

A set of easy to use, built-in message processors.

[Check out the processor code here](https://github.com/open-wa/wa-automate-nodejs/blob/master/src/structures/preProcessors.ts)

## Enumeration Members

### AUTO\_DECRYPT

• **AUTO\_DECRYPT** = ``"AUTO_DECRYPT"``

Replaces the media thumbnail base64 in `body` with the actual file's DataURL.

___

### AUTO\_DECRYPT\_SAVE

• **AUTO\_DECRYPT\_SAVE** = ``"AUTO_DECRYPT_SAVE"``

Automatically saves the file in a folder named `/media` relative to the process working directory.

PLEASE NOTE, YOU WILL NEED TO MANUALLY CLEAR THIS FOLDER!!!

___

### BODY\_ONLY

• **BODY\_ONLY** = ``"BODY_ONLY"``

A preprocessor that limits the amount of base64 data is present in the message object by removing duplication of `body` in `content` by replacing `content` with `""`.

___

### SCRUB

• **SCRUB** = ``"SCRUB"``

This preprocessor scrubs `body` and `content` from media messages.
This would be useful if you want to reduce the message object size because neither of these values represent the actual file, only the thumbnail.

___

### UPLOAD\_CLOUD

• **UPLOAD\_CLOUD** = ``"UPLOAD_CLOUD"``

Uploads file to a cloud storage provider (GCP/AWS for now).

If this preprocessor is set then you have to also set [`cloudUploadOptions`](https://docs.openwa.dev/interfaces/api_model_config.ConfigObject.html#cloudUploadOptions) in the config.
